## 🚀 About Me  

Recent B.Tech graduate with hands-on experience across the **software development lifecycle (SDLC)** — including **development, testing, and deployment awareness**. I build backend applications using **Java and Spring Boot** and actively perform **manual and exploratory testing** to ensure product quality.

I enjoy validating end-to-end workflows, identifying edge cases, reporting defects clearly, and collaborating to improve system reliability. I am currently strengthening my skills in **automation testing concepts, API testing, and CI/CD workflows** to grow into an **SDET / QA-focused role**.
